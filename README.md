# An Algorithmic Trading System.
This system is built in Python and uses a Random Forest Algorithm to make trading decisions.

It can trade on any NASDAQ or NYSE stock, as long as it is not newly listed (we need at least some data).

It generates a buy, sell, or hold recommendation before each trading day.

The system takes care of new positions as well as managing risk for existing positions.
